# CCDash-Ext

A custom User-script built to improve a dashboard website I used while working with California Closets. This script was used to improved user experience. It speed up reporting tasks by pulling data then making calculations and putting results in dashboard UI. This also added improved UI experience. This project is now obsolete due to new changes with in company and no longer being with company.
